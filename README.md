Inspiration:
 Every 1 out of 4 people suffer from mental illness and no one can be available for anyone every time.
  This was our biggest inspiration.
What it does:
  It is an app to help develop mental health and provide features like meditation, music, affirmations
  and interesting articles about how can you start journaling, decrease caffeine intake, and severe 
  conditions like how to deal with suicidal thoughts.
How we built it:
 We have built this Android application with Java as backend and    XML for frontend and used android 
 studio.
Challenges we ran into:
 The biggest challenge was integrating all the elements of the application.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
  We have finally integrated everything and made the app as planned. 
What we learned:
 We learned various things such as different layouts, list view, recycler view, web view, GitHub, and 
 much more.
What's next for Cosmic:
We have planned to add a bookmark feature for affirmations and articles and embed meditation 
videos and bedtime stories.
